# Backend for a movies watchlist/reviews web application - made in Spring Boot (Maven) and runs with a MongoDB on Docker container
For now it only stores and retrieves some movies but registering and login functionalities will come.
The idea is that a user can log in, watch a movie trailer on the frontend, add a movie to watchlist or leave a review for a movie.
